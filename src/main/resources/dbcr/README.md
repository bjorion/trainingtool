## DBCR (Database Change Request)

This folder contains the DDL (Data Definition Language) commands for modifying the structure of the DB.

Please name the sql files like `tt-dbcr-<version>.sql` where *version* is the application version number.
There should only be (at the most) one such file per version.

Ex: **tt-dbcr-1.0.0.sql**
